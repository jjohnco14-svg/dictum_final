chunk_grammar.py -- Context-aware, per-chunk GBNF generation.

WHY THIS EXISTS
----------------
dictum_safe.gbnf / dictum_unsafe.gbnf (the structural rewrite) fixed the
HANG problem: a single, fixed grammar for the whole language, loaded once
per Build call and reused for every chunk. That grammar is still a
superset of what any ONE chunk actually needs -- a TYPE chunk's grammar
still contains if/while/repeat/print/call branches it will never use, and
every chunk's `identifier` terminal is the fully open
`[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`, so the model is grammar-legally free to invent
names that were never in the plan. That's the LOOPHOLE problem: outputs
that are syntactically valid but don't match the plan, wasting a retry
instead of a hang.

This module builds a fresh, narrower grammar for ONE chunk, derived from
that chunk's own `[PLAN: ...]` items, instead of loading one of the two
static files. It does not replace dictum_safe.gbnf/dictum_unsafe.gbnf --
those remain correct, general-purpose fallbacks (see chunkGrammar.js),
and this module's rule BODIES are copied from them verbatim; only which
rules/branches are *included* changes per chunk.

IMPORTANT, VERIFIED CONSTRAINT (parser.py:parse_top_level): the only
legal top-level forms in real Dictum are `program`, `module`, `shape`,
`action`, `use`, `bind`, `import`, `extern`, `define`. A bare top-level
`keep` (global constant) is NOT legal -- `parse_top_level` raises
"Unknown top-level 'keep'" for it. This matters here because it means a
TYPE-tier chunk whose plan items are literal `keep X as ... with value
...` lines (as opposed to `shape X holds ...` lines) cannot be satisfied
by ANY grammar that only allows top-level declarations -- that's a
Plan-prompt-level mismatch, not something a tighter GBNF can route around.
This module's TYPE-tier handling assumes shape-decl items (the form
SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md's chunking description actually documents: "shape's
field can be another shape") and falls back to also allowing action-decl
(wrapping any bare `keep` items inside a small init action body) if no
`shape ... holds` pattern is found in the chunk -- a safety net, not a
fix for the underlying prompt issue.

SECOND VERIFIED CONSTRAINT: chunking.js's real per-item granularity for
OPERATION is coarser than a naive reading of "one plan item per
statement" suggests. `extractOperationAction` matches OPERATION item
descriptions against `/^action (\\w+)/i` (used to attach a matching
INVARIANT's "inside action X," item to the SAME chunk) -- meaning one
real OPERATION plan item is expected to describe an entire action's body
in prose, not one bare statement per item. Because of that, this module
does NOT attempt fine-grained per-statement-kind whitelisting for
OPERATION/MODIFY chunks (a single prose description can legitimately
imply `if`, `while`, or any combination without using those literal
words) -- it restricts identifiers/dtypes/top-decl-kind there and leaves
the statement-kind and operator branches at full width. Fine-grained
statement-kind whitelisting IS applied for TYPE and MEMORY/SAFETY tiers,
where real items genuinely are one-line, one-construct-per-item (a single
`keep`/`RAW_MALLOC`/`RAW_FREE` line each).

USAGE
-----
Reads one JSON object from stdin:
    {"tierName": "OPERATION", "items": [{"category": "...", "id": "...",
     "desc": "..."}], "unsafe": false}
Writes the generated GBNF grammar text to stdout. On any failure (empty
items, unrecognized tier, internal error) exits non-zero and writes
nothing to stdout -- chunkGrammar.js treats that as "fall back to the
static file", never as a hard error, so a bug in this module can only
ever make chunk generation LESS tight, not broken.

CLI equivalent for manual/Kaggle testing:
    python3 chunk_grammar.py --self-test
runs a handful of representative chunks through the generator and prints
each one's rule count next to the static file's, for a quick sanity
check without needing the VS Code extension in the loop at all.

# FIX (semantic-failure sweep, Cell 8 results): DTYPE_PHRASES used to be an
# 8-entry hand-copied list, independent of type_registry.py -- the module
# that exists specifically so a type only has to be added ONCE. Because of
# that drift, `nothing` (var_valid=False -- "only legal as a return type",
# literally the registry's own docstring example) was never offered to the
# GBNF at all. With no legal way to emit `produces nothing`, the model's
# only path for an untyped/no-return action was the `identifier` fallback,
# which grabbed whatever name was nearby (a param name, its own action
# name) -- the direct cause of Tier4/5/6/7's bad return types. Deriving
# DTYPE_PHRASES from the registry both fixes that gap and means this list
# can never independently drift from parser/validator/emit_c again.

# PHASE 3 -- synonym-tolerant grammar (NL-appreciation direction: the
# pipeline's Plan/Review stages already lean on the model's NL fluency,
# but Build's GBNF locked every keyword to ONE literal spelling --
# fighting the exact thing a language model is naturally good at
# (expressing one intent several fluent ways) instead of using it. This
# section widens five statement-trigger keywords plus the two connector
# phrases inside keep-stmt/field-decl/param (`as`, `with value`) into
# small, curated synonym alternations, so the model can say what it
# means in whatever fluent way it reaches for first.
#
# SCOPE, DELIBERATELY BOUNDED: this does NOT touch `to` (set-stmt),
# `giving` (call-stmt), `holds`/`takes`/`produces`, or any
# CMP_PHRASES/ARITH_PHRASES literal. Two reasons: (1) several of those
# share short, common English words ("to", "with") with OTHER grammar
# positions (CMP_PHRASES' "equal to", ARITH_PHRASES' operators) where a
# synonym swap needs its own collision analysis before it's safe; (2)
# widening the grammar and writing normalize_dictum.py's matching
# canonicalize_synonyms() reverse-mapping are one atomic change -- five
# keywords + two connectors is what's verified end-to-end (grammar ->
# real parser) this pass. Widening further is a follow-up, not silently
# bundled in here.
#
# Because Build's decoding is grammar-CONSTRAINED (llama.cpp only ever
# samples a token the active GBNF rule allows), normalize_dictum.py's
# canonicalizer isn't guessing which of several things the model might
# have meant -- it's reversing a closed, known set of literal strings
# that could only have appeared at the exact rule position this module
# put them in. That's a stronger guarantee than ordinary post-hoc regex

# DISPOSABLE-RESERVE IMPORT_C MECHANISM
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Two independent problems, both upstream of "could the model

# path for `import from C ...` at all for any OPERATION/MODIFY/
# INVARIANT/MEMORY/SAFETY chunk (STMT_TRIGGERS/allowed_top never
# include it), and (2) most named C functions besides sqrt have no
# parseable NL form in parser.py's prefix-expression grammar (floor/
# ceil/fabs/log have none at all; sqrt only works if the model happens
# to write "square root of" instead of a plan's literal "the sqrt of").
# So today an IMPORT_C item for floor/ceil/fabs/log is unsatisfiable no
# matter how good the grammar or the model is -- fixing that has to
# come before a whitelist matters at all.
#
# The fix: render the `import from C ...` statement DETERMINISTICALLY
# (never model-sampled -- there's nothing to hallucinate in a line the
# model never had to produce), then let the ordinary, already-supported
# `call c_{name} with X giving Result` statement reach it from inside
# the chunk's normal grammar-constrained body. The whitelist
# (KNOWN_C_IMPORTS) is the hard gate that keeps this narrow even across
# a build with hundreds of IMPORT_C-style plan items: the candidate set
# for any ONE chunk is {KNOWN_C_IMPORTS} intersect {names literally in
# THIS chunk's own plan text}, minus {names an earlier chunk already

# exact count -- so the moment the model emitted the minimum legal one
# param, the grammar was already satisfied and happily closed with `]`,
# giving `[ATOMIC_FAA: Counter ]` instead of the required
# `[ATOMIC_FAA: Counter : 1]`. Unlike the generic simple-stmt count
# (genuinely prose-dependent, see _estimate_stmt_count), each unsafe
# op's arity is a FIXED fact about the operation itself, not something
# that needs estimating from text at all: RAW_MALLOC always takes
# (size, name-to-bind), RAW_FREE always takes (name), ATOMIC_FAA always
# takes (name, delta). Splitting unsafe-token into one exact-arity
# sub-rule per op name (instead of one shared shape with a param-count
# range) closes the loophole structurally rather than by guessing a
# tighter range.

# real arity is THREE params, not two -- confirmed by 21/21 real

# `[ATOMIC_FAA: <pointer> : <delta> : <result-variable>]`. The Cell 9-11
# fix that introduced UNSAFE_ARITY guessed 2 (pointer, delta) from the
# test suite's own plan text ("ATOMIC_FAA Counter 1"), which was itself
# wrong -- it never mentioned the result variable at all, and used the
