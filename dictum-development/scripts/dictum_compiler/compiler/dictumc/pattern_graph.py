pattern_graph.py -- storage + lookup + binding for the codegraph pattern
database (see codegraph/PATTERN_SCHEMA.md for the full field contract).

WHY THIS EXISTS: Cell 9/10/11 established that GBNF grammar constraints
restrict *shape* but can't teach a model Dictum's *content* -- a model
that has never seen Dictum in training fills an open slot with whatever
Python/C/JS habit is nearest (lowercasing a variable name, inventing
f-string interpolation, swapping unsafe-token param order, ...). This
module's job is retrieval: given a `pattern_ref` (and optionally params
to bind), return a ready-to-inject block of few-shot context -- a
correct, concrete Dictum example plus its stated preconditions and known
failure modes -- for the Build prompt to include. It does NOT touch
chunk_grammar.py's GBNF generation; wiring a pattern's shape into the
grammar itself is a separate, later integration (see PATTERN_SCHEMA.md's
"Deliberately NOT done yet" section).

STORAGE: one JSON file per pattern in codegraph/patterns/<pattern_ref>.json
-- the same filesystem-as-database convention already used by
skills/library/<name>/*.dict and graphify-out/cache/ast/*.json elsewhere
in this repo, not a new storage dependency.

out/patternGraph.js can use the identical spawn/stdin/stdout bridge shape
as out/normalizeDictum.js):

# The section above only fires for two named, hand-registered
# pattern_refs (atomic-increment, unsafe-malloc), each with its own
# bespoke regex -- i.e. it's keyed on WHICH pattern the caller already
# decided this is, the same "per-tier lookup" shape the grammar routing
# problem had. But most of Tier3/5's real failures (Cell 12d) weren't
# an unsafe-op idiom at all -- they were an ordinary `keep X as T [with
# value V]` followed by a later reference to X, which is fully
# mechanical (a straight transcription of the plan's own sentence
# order into Dictum surface syntax) but still went through the
# GBNF+LLM sampler because nothing recognized it as such. This section
# generalizes the SAME "skip the model when nothing is left to decide"
# principle to any chunk whose entire body is a plain sequence of
# keep/set/print/call/release statements -- not keyed to a pattern_ref,
# a tier name, or any hand-registered list, just to the grammatical
# SHAPE of the plan text.
#
# Scope, and why each boundary is drawn where it is (bail = fall back
# to the normal grammar+LLM path unchanged, per this module's existing
# "never worse than before" contract):
#   - No control-flow trigger (if/while/repeat) anywhere in the text.
#     Loop/branch bodies require real judgment about what belongs
#     inside vs. outside the block -- genuinely not mechanical.
#   - No `unsafe` block, no `takes` clause (params need per-param type
#     binding this pass doesn't attempt yet -- documented gap, not a
#     silent guess).
#   - No arithmetic/comparison phrase anywhere in the text -- a `value`
#     slot here is only ever a literal, a string, or a bare variable
#     reference, never an expression to evaluate.
#   - Every trigger-to-next-trigger text span must match its clause
#     regex WITH NOTHING LEFT OVER (past connector words/punctuation).
#     Any leftover content means the plan said something this expander
#     doesn't understand -- bail rather than guess.
